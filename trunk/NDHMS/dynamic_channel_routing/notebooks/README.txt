Most of the notebooks in this folder may be opened with Google Colaboratory. They represent
experiments to demonstrate the base classes and basic functionality of libraries contained in 
rest of the repoository. Collectively they are intended to support incorporation of evaluation 
of the dynamic routing codes and related utilities being considered and prepared as potential
candidates for use as the base dynamic hydraulic engine for the NWM. 

In general, as with all things related to the National Water Center, our goal is to save
more lives and prevent more property damage by more accurately forecasting the state of the nations
rivers and other water resources, especially with respect to floods and by getting that
information more quickly and understandably to people who can and will do something 
useful with it to those ends.

The purpose in sharing this via GitHub is to efficiently make possible collaborative 
editing -- because there are certainly those who have more experience and expertise who
might comment on how this has been done or how it might be better done here.
