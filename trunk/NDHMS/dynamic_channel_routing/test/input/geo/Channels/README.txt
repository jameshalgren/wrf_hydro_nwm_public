# The CONUS_ge5 and Brazos_LowerColorado_ge5 datasets included here
# in the github test folder are extracts from the NHD version 1.2 datasets
# from https://www.nohrsc.noaa.gov/pub/staff/keicher/NWM_live/web/data_tools/
#  
# The CONUS_FULL_RES file was generated from the RouteLink file in the parameter
# archive and converted to a compressed NetCDF via the following command:
# nccopy -d1 -s RouteLink_NWMv2.0_20190517_cheyenne_pull.nc RouteLink_NWMv2.0_20190517_cheyenne_pull.nc4s
# See notes here: https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/workshops/2011/utilities/NccopyExamples.html

# CONUS_Named_Streams was generated by intersecting the FULL_RES file ...
